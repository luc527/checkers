Currently working on a more interactive terminal interface using ncurses.
Also planning to implement a min-max algorithm in the future for the player to play against the computer.

Here's the previous stdin/stdout-based interaction loop:

Here's the current ncurses-based interaction loop, which is very rudimentary and, for now, wrong even.
